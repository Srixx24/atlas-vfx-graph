<h2>This project utilizes Unity 6 with HDRP to explore the capabilities of beat detection by analyzing audio clips and triggering gameplay events based on detected beats. </h2>

<br>

<h3>I developed a system that synchronizes audio track frequencies to cloud systems in the game, creating a dynamic sky that moves with the audio tracks. Additionally, I've made a trigger response tied to the player's climbing progress. To achieve this, I applied the audio pitches to in-game objects, leveraging beat-detection technology to create interactive 'step stones' that track the player's progress in the game. This allows for a seamless and immersive experience, where the visual and auditory elements are linked, enhancing the overall gameplay. </h3>

<center> <h3>Project Goals</h3> </center>
<ul>
<li>The core of this project is the beat detection algorithm, which processes audio clips to identify beats based on amplitude and frequency.</li>
<li>Provide visual effects created using Unity's particle system, responding dynamically to detected beats and managing them through a state machine that triggers actions based on beat detection.</li>
<li>Ensure fluid visuals and responsive interactions based on the frequencies of the audio clips.</li>
<li>Provide comprehensive documentation and information that encapsulates architectural decisions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>This game is a revamp of my original project when I was very new to unity and just starting to build games. I am proud to provide a then and now of my skills and how they've developed.</h3>
