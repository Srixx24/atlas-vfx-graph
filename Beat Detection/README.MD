<h2>This project utilizes Unity 6 with HDRP to explore the capabilities of beat detection by analyzing audio clips and triggering gameplay events based on detected beats.</h2>

<center> <h3>Project Goals</h3> </center>
<ul>
<li>The core of this project is the beat detection algorithm, which processes audio clips to identify beats based on amplitude and frequency.</li>
<li>Provide visual effects created using Unity's particle system, responding dynamically to detected beats and managing them through a state machine that triggers actions based on beat detection.</li>
<li>Ensure fluid visuals and responsive interactions based on the frequencies of the audio clips.</li>
<li>Provide comprehensive documentation and information that encapsulates architectural decisions.</li>
</ul>
